  <description>Life finds a way.

Jurassic Rimworld brings the wonder and excitement of dinosaurs from the hit franchise right into the chaos of colony management. Hunt or be hunted, breed your own dinosaurs, create your own park, or unleash prehistoric fury on your enemies. The possibilities are endless!

Features include:
- Over one hundred prehistoric creatures, including dinosaurs, pterosaurs, synapsids, invertebrates and many more.
- Large and medium creatures can be used as pack animals, to travel in style!
- Buildings, turrets, walls and floors to decorate in jurassic style and secure your base from dinosaur (or raider) attacks.
- Mineable amber, extraction benches and DNA reconstructing to bring your own creatures back from the past.
- Unique sounds and music!
- Much, much more!

An extremely big thank you to: Mehni, Lanilor, Shotty, Flake, JayFoxley, Jules, SoggyNoodle, my wonderful Twerp, and everyone else who helped contribute to the mod and kept me going. Thank you so, so much.</description>
